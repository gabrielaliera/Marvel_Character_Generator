Submitted by: **Gabriela Liera**

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Marvel Character Search** is an android app that displays a random character from the Marvel API. Users can also search for characters.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü§ñü¶∏üßê**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **nameStartWith and limit**
- [X] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] Use ViewBinding

## Notes

Throughout this lab, I acquired the skills to effectively select an API and comprehend its documentation to grasp its capabilities and integrate it into my project. I demonstrated the ability to examine and parse the JSON response from the API and then present various fields from the response in a visually appealing format. Additionally, I implemented a search query that enables users to search for characters that begin with the input they provide. Lastly, I constructed a user-friendly UI that allows users to enter the search parameters by creating input fields and a search button. While facing a few bugs, I utilized Logcat to tag debug statements to comprehend the data flow and JSON response parsing process. In summary, I acquired knowledge of the complete process, which includes selecting an API, comprehending its documentation, parsing the JSON response, extracting data, adding a query to the API request, and building a UI for users to specify query parameters.
